# Chef cookbook example using Test Kitchen & InSpec Verifier

As of 2015-11-03, you can get started with [kitchen-inspec](https://github.com/chef/kitchen-inspec) and the ChefDK distribution by installing the Verifier from RubyGems with:

```sh
chef gem install kitchen-inspec
```

**Note** a future version of ChefDK will most likely bundle this Verifier for further convenience.
